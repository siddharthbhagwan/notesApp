### General Information

#### Note - Now updated to Webpack 4!

My goal with this project was to make a simple Webpack starter template for use in modern-day development projects. While it is a good thing that a lot of the popular frameworks bundle their own CLI's to help scaffold projects, I felt I was losing something in translation - especially when it came to Webpack and the project initialization.

I've used [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) in the past - and have been using [Gulp](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj43N6Mn-bVAhXo5YMKHehPBYUQFggoMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgulpjs%2Fgulp&usg=AFQjCNFA8IbRiWBlkSJKjQyVnUb3ktwCwg) for many years now, and while Gulp and Grunt have been awesome, I believe the concepts Webpack introduces are critical and must be utilized in my projects going forward. I especially liked how Webpack coordinates everything for you - no more including code in the wrong order.

An issue I've had is finding a repository or tutorial that doesn't go too far - as I find it can be harmful when you are given too much - or too little - when learning.

So this project stops right before you would add a framework of your choosing. I've emulated a simple `async/await` promise call just to show that babel is working correctly.

In the end, I am an even bigger fan of Webpack now then when I started - although if I plan to use a framework in my application with 100% certainty - I may continue to choose the framework's chosen CLI tool when scaffolding with Webpack. Depends on the circumstances of course. I do really like `vue-cli`. It's just that sometimes I've found myself with the need to set it up myself - so this was a great learning experience, and hopefully it helps you.
